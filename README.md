### Connecting to the database from the host machine

Since the database is in a docker container, connecting to it from the
host machine is as simple as:

```bash
mysql --protocol=tcp -P33069 -uhackdawg -ppassword
```

### Connecting to the database using a GUI

Most database GUIs out there supports importing a database from a url:

```bash
mysql://hackdawg:password@127.0.0.1:33069/hackdawg
```
